# Gaming News
A repository about weekly gaming news, inspired by Kotaku or Polygon, but better. This is a public project, so anyone can work on it. I am excited for this project to grow throughout GitHub and make it more popular.

# Daily News - October 9 - Shadow of War has a PC Game, which has a download of nearly 100GB
The popular and upcoming game Middle Earth: Shadow of War, may be a game you need a additional hard drive for. It has a whopping 97.7 GB full of gaming, so you may want to buy a hard drive or extra storage before you buy.

The weird thing is, on PS4, Shadow of War is 61.27. The solution to saving your PC money is to opt-out of the 4K content used in the game, but only after you have started downloading it. The new GB count is around 65 GB, but, it still saves your storage.

In short, people don't really now why Middle Earth: Shadow of War is so big, but I have one idea. Maybe all those orcs fled the LEGO world and joined in. Watch for the orcs!

# Daily News Becomes Weekly - October 14
Hello GitHub users.
I'm am terribly sorry that I have missed the past 3 days. I'm very busy right now, and I just can't work on this project right now.
So I didn't think I would say this, but Gaming News is no longer Daily; it has now become Weekly Gaming News.

# Weekly News - October 18 - Fortnite: Battle Royale is blowing up!
Fortnite: Battle Royale is a FTP (free to play) battle royale style game, much like PUBG. This game has gotten a lot of love over the past couple of weeks, and I am here to cover it all.

First, the game is free to play for the whole year. Epic Games has announced a price tag in 2018, so you have much time to play it for free. Second, the game is on 4 platforms; Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Mac. This enables a lot more users to be attracted to the game.

I play this game on Xbox, and it is so fun. The games are really fast, and take maybe up to 20-25 minutes max. PUBG has longer matches, and Fortnite also has about a 5 minute wait time for queing up for games.

In short, I really like this game, and you can purchase it [here, for free](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale). The game is really addicting and has tons of players. I hope you enjoy the game for yourself, or already have it and enjoy it as much as I do!

# Weekly News - October 29 - Super Mario Odyssey is awesome!
Nintendo has hyped up their entire community by releasing the new Super Mario Odyssey game for the Nintendo Switch. This game features the new companion for Mario, Cappy!

Cappy is the hat that Mario wears (hence the name), and he can change Mario into anything he touches! The game features T-Rexs', Cheep Cheep's, Hammer Brothers, Bowser, and many other recurring enemies from previous Mario games!

Many people reference Odyssey to the N64 classic Super Mario 64. If you did not know, this was the first 3D and open-world Mario game for Nintendo.

Since this game was hyped up so much, consumers have the choice to buy many accessories, like new amiibos! To enjoy the marriage of Bowser and Peach, Nintendo has released Mario Bowser and Peach anniversary amiibos, and, I think, that personally, they look very cool and are nice to look at. Other accessories include a carrying case, a wired controller, and much more to go with the game.

In short, this game looks incredibley awesome, and you can purchase it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01MY7GHKJ/ref=sr_1_2?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1509315137&sr=1-2&keywords=super+mario+odyssey) for $59.99 on Amazon. I really hope you buy this game, and I'll see you next time on Weekly Gaming News!
