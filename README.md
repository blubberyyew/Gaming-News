# Daily News - October 9 - Shadow of War has a PC Game, which has a download of nearly 100GB
The popular and upcoming game Middle Earth: Shadow of War, may be a game you need a additional hard drive for. It has a whopping 97.7 GB full of gaming, so you may want to buy a hard drive or extra storage before you buy.

The weird thing is, on PS4, Shadow of War is 61.27. The solution to saving your PC money is to opt-out of the 4K content used in the game, but only after you have started downloading it. The new GB count is around 65 GB, but, it still saves your storage.

In short, people don't really now why Middle Earth: Shadow of War is so big, but I have one idea. Maybe all those orcs fled the LEGO world and joined in. Watch for the orcs!
