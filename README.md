# Gaming News
A repository about weekly gaming news, like Kotaku or Polygon, but better. This is a public project, so anyone can work on it. I am excited for this project to grow throughout GitHub and make it more popular.

# Daily News - October 9 - Shadow of War has a PC Game, which has a download of nearly 100GB
The popular and upcoming game Middle Earth: Shadow of War, may be a game you need a additional hard drive for. It has a whopping 97.7 GB full of gaming, so you may want to buy a hard drive or extra storage before you buy.

The weird thing is, on PS4, Shadow of War is 61.27. The solution to saving your PC money is to opt-out of the 4K content used in the game, but only after you have started downloading it. The new GB count is around 65 GB, but, it still saves your storage.

In short, people don't really now why Middle Earth: Shadow of War is so big, but I have one idea. Maybe all those orcs fled the LEGO world and joined in. Watch for the orcs!

Hey guys, I'm sorry I missed the day yesterday. I am a student and needed to work on some things and forgot about Gaming News. I will still make a post tommorrow, and I promise I won't miss it.

# Daily News Becomes Weekly - October 14
Hello GitHub users.
I'm am terribly sorry that I have missed the past 3 days. My life right now is very busy, and I just can't work on this project right now.
So I didn't think I would say this, but Gaming News is no longer Daily; it has now become Weekly Gaming News.
